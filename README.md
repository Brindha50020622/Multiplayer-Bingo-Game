**MULTIPLAYER BINGO GAME**
  The Bingo game comprises a server and multiple clients, each representing an individual player. The server manages game state, synchronizes player actions, and broadcasts updates,
while each client displays a personalized Bingo card and listens for updates. Utilizing Python's socket library for network communication, threading for handling simultaneous client 
connections, and tkinter for GUI, the system ensures smooth gameplay and real-time responsiveness.
